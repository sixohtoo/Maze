# Maze
Generates a maze using pygame in 2 different styles (so far).

# To use
run `python3 PrimBarrier.py` to start Randomised Prim's Algorithm maze generator.

run `python3 BackTrackingWall.py` to start the Backtracking Algorithm maze generator.

Click on any grid square to make a starting node.

Press spacebar to start maze generator alogorithm.


# Randomised Prim's Algorithm
Generates a maze with barriers using the Randomised Prim's Algorithm.

These mazes tend to be relatively simple to solve with lots of short dead ends
due to the algorithm's fully randomised nature.

# Backtracking Algorithm
Generates a maze with walls using the Backtracking Algorithm.

These mazes tend to have long, winding paths and are can be very difficult to solve.
